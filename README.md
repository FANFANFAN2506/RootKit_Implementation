# RootKit_Implementation

## This is the project for 23Spring ECE550, submitted by Fan Yang:

In this assignment, a RootKit implementation is achieved with the following functionalities:
1. Hands-on practice with kernel programming
2. A detailed understanding of the operation of system calls within the kernel
3. Utilized with fork/exec to launch child processes
4. An understanding of the types of malicious activities that attackers may attempt against asystem

By running the program, I could do some malicious attacks to the system without being notice, as I intercepted the original system call, and replace with my own.
